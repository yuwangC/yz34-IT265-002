#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  What if the task is to make a horror game as bright as possible in warm colors, how can we implement elements that differ from horror games in general
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
